	<p>There are many applications for HTML character entity references, however in this lecture, I will concentrate only on a particular problem that the entity references can solve for us. Since HTML uses certain characters for its syntax, we need a way to differentiate between those characters as HTML and those same characters as content. If we want the browser to interpret special HTML characters as regular content, we need a way to escape them. In other words, we need a way to tell the browser not to interpret them&nbsp;as&nbsp;HTML.
